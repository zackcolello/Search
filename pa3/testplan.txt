For our large-scale test, we used a directory that contained text files of The
Great Gatsby and Alice in Wonderland, as well as indexing those two text
documents by themselves. The resulting output file was about 22
thousand lines. Our program handled these large test cases with no errors, and
the output file was correct as expected.
